## ðŸ“Š USAGE MONITORING

### Dashboard Integration Ready
- **Usage summaries**: Current vs. limits for all resources
- **Feature availability**: Boolean flags for plan features
- **Permission integration**: Combined with existing authorization
- **Real-time checking**: Limits checked on every action

### Example Usage Response
```json
{
  "plan": "free",
  "billboards": { "current": 5, "limit": 5, "can_create": false },
  "contracts": { "current": 2, "limit": 2, "can_create": false },
  "team_members": { "current": 1, "limit": 1, "can_invite": false },
  "features": {
    "team_invitations": false,
    "advanced_analytics": false,
    "export_enabled": false
  }
}
```

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT READY

### Database Migrations
- âœ… `plan_feature_rules` table updated with comprehensive features
- âœ… `system_notifications` table created
- âœ… All migrations tested and working

### Background Tasks
- âœ… Command for checking limits: `php artisan subscription:check-limits`
- âœ… Notification cleanup: Automatic expired notification removal
- âœ… Observer integration: Real-time notifications on model changes

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE BENEFITS

1. **Revenue Protection**: Users can't exceed plan limits
2. **Upgrade Motivation**: Clear notifications about feature limitations
3. **User Experience**: Transparent usage tracking and helpful upgrade prompts
4. **Automated Monitoring**: System automatically tracks and notifies about usage
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new features and limits

## ðŸ“‹ NEXT STEPS FOR FRONTEND INTEGRATION

1. **Notification Bell**: Display unread count in navigation
2. **Usage Widgets**: Show current usage vs. limits on dashboard
3. **Upgrade Prompts**: Link notifications to subscription upgrade flow
4. **Feature Gates**: Hide/disable features based on plan access
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live notifications

## ðŸ”§ MAINTENANCE COMMANDS

```bash
# Check subscription limits for all companies
php artisan subscription:check-limits

# Check limits for specific company
php artisan subscription:check-limits --company-id=1

# Run tests to verify functionality
php artisan test tests/Feature/SubscriptionLimitTest.php
```

This implementation provides a robust foundation for subscription-based feature access and proactive user communication about plan limitations.
